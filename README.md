- 👋 Hi, I’m @pr4ytowin
- 👀 I’m interested in music production, coding, data science, and playing chess
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data science with python, machine learning, and I am starting to learn swift for iOS applications
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a new chess game variation app that I have not seen before, with either swift or python
- 📫 How to reach me: pr4y.content@gmail.com (coding related) or pr4ytowin@gmail.com (need music? beats? a jingle? video game sounds? mixing and mastering production) 
- 👑 ALSO! Any chess players, play me in chess! Add me as a friend pr4ytowin on chess.com or lichess.com
